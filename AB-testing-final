RESULT ANALYSIS
4. The P value for the results of the View binary is 0.20 that means that the result is not statistically significant and the lift of 2.6% is not meaningful. 
3. P value is at 0.88. No statistical importance. There is no improvement but a -1% in probability. 
QA
1. No we didn't have all the data needed.
